[CHAPTER 1]
A month ago I set out to build a free open-source PDF chat app. I honestly expected it to be super easy.

Upload a PDF, extract the text, feed it to an LLM. What could go wrong?

As it turned out, PDF parsing proved extremely annoying. I tried PyMuPDF, Unstructured, Chunkr, and every other PDF parsing library I could find. They were either painfully slow, prohibitively expensive, or produced garbage output. Server-side processing meant users waited 20+ seconds watching a spinner. Adding PDF processing to my backend added a lot of complexity. Worst of all, as a user, I didn't love the experience.

The Enterprise PDF Processing Disaster Nobody Talks About
While debugging my app, I started talking to enterprise engineering teams about their PDF processing. The scale they were working at genuinely surprised me. One consumer chat app with millions of active users processes tens of millions of PDF pages a month. For another it's in the range of hundreds of millions of pages.

The infrastructure always looks the same: a microservice with PyMuPDF or similar library that's constantly needing maintenance, and costs tens of thousands per month. As the microservice grows, it needs load balancers for traffic distribution, queue systems for spikes, and a DevOps constantly handling fires.
