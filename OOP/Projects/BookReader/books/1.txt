[CHAPTER 1]
Starting a YouTube channel is something many people would love to do, but insecurities stop them. Luckily, there are some creative ways you can skip showing your face or talking.

The simplest way would be to use stock footage, a voiceover artist, or a text-to-speech app like Wellsaid Labs. This is what I did for my faceless YouTube channels.

These options require investing money, but if you have a low budget, there are other ways to create videos.

Data Visualization
Presenting data in a visually pleasing way can turn into a lucrative YouTube channel.

One example of this is Stat Star. Their top 10 chess FIDE rating video gained over 3.5 million views. The video is simple to make and features the top 10 chess players rating over the years. Some videos include animations and videos, but no face reveal or voice is used.

The channel is not limited to chess. It also publishes videos on football players, figure skating, movies, and other niches. There is a ton of data out there that can be used for this.

If you enjoy working with numbers, then give this idea a try.
