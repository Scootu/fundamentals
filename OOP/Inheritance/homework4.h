Analysis of the Mammal Inheritance Design
The current design uses a base Mammal class with three methods:

java
class Mammal {
    boolean givesMilk()
    String makeSound()
    boolean givesLiveBirth()
}
And specialized subclasses for specific mammals that override makeSound().

Key Issue: Overgeneralization
The problem lies in the givesLiveBirth() method. While it correctly describes:

Cats (viviparous)

Monkeys (viviparous)

Whales (viviparous)

It fails for egg-laying mammals (monotremes):

ðŸ¥š Platypus and Echidna are mammals that:

Produce milk (givesMilk() = true)

Make sounds (makeSound() is valid)

But lay eggs instead of giving live birth (givesLiveBirth() = false)

Why This Breaks the Design
Incorrect inheritance: Forcing all mammals to inherit givesLiveBirth() = true violates biological reality

Liskov Substitution Principle failure: A Platypus can't substitute the base Mammal class without breaking behavior

Missing abstraction: Not all mammals share the same reproductive method

Counterexample: Platypus Implementation
java
class Platypus extends Mammal {
    @Override
    String makeSound() { return "Growl"; }
    
    // PROBLEM: Must override givesLiveBirth() to return false,
    // but base class implies live birth is universal to mammals
}
This exposes the design flaw:

Either Platypus incorrectly reports live birth (violating real-world facts)

Or we need to override the method, making the base class contract misleading

Design Improvement
Solution: Refactor using interfaces

java
interface MilkProducer {
    boolean givesMilk();  // Default: true for all mammals
}

interface SoundMaker {
    String makeSound();   // Species-specific
}

interface LiveBirth {
    boolean givesLiveBirth();  // Only for viviparous mammals
}

interface EggLayer {
    boolean laysEggs();   // For monotremes
}

class Platypus implements MilkProducer, SoundMaker, EggLayer {
    @Override public boolean givesMilk() { return true; }
    @Override public String makeSound() { return "Growl"; }
    @Override public boolean laysEggs() { return true; }
}
Key Advantages
Accurate modeling: Separates mammal characteristics that aren't universal

Extensibility: Easy to add new mammals with diverse traits

Avoids false assumptions: No forced inheritance of irrelevant behaviors

Clear contracts: Each interface defines a specific biological capability

ðŸ’¡ Tip for the Engineer: "Not all mammal characteristics are universal. Model variable traits (like reproduction) as separate interfaces rather than forcing them into a monolithic base class. Biology has exceptions!"
